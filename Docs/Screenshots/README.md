# Screenshots Directory

This directory is used for storing development progress screenshots and debugging visuals.

## Purpose

- **Progress Tracking**: Document visual changes and feature additions
- **Bug Reporting**: Capture screenshots of issues for debugging
- **Feature Demonstration**: Show implemented features to stakeholders
- **Documentation**: Visual aids for documentation and tutorials

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive filenames with dates for easy organization:

- `YYYY-MM-DD_feature-name.png` - Feature screenshots
- `YYYY-MM-DD_bug-description.png` - Bug/issue screenshots
- `YYYY-MM-DD_test-scenario.png` - Test case screenshots

## Examples

- `2025-12-12_water-rendering-waves.png` - Water wave animation
- `2025-12-12_underwater-bubbles.png` - Bubble particle effects
- `2025-12-12_vegetation-growth-stages.png` - Plant growth visualization
- `2025-12-12_terrain-generation-biomes.png` - Different biome types

## Usage

When working on visual features:
1. Take screenshots at key milestones
2. Save them to this directory with descriptive names
3. Reference them in pull request descriptions
4. Include them in documentation when relevant

## Note

Screenshots are included in the repository to maintain a visual history of the project's development. Large or numerous files should be optimized or compressed to keep repository size manageable.
